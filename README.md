A music playing TUI program often used for ricing purposes, the program plays on mpv and demands only few dependencies unlike other independent music players that require another bullshit installation of 50+ different packages into the system and telling you to pass a music server which is exhausting and infuriating to setup. Since most users have mpv and ffmpeg already installed, the configuration should be simple.

Background of the terminal can be changed by writing another ascii art inside the landscape shell function.

## Images
For anyone who's struggling, this shows the difference between libsixel and chafa. If you wish to stick with chafa, you can replace those lines in the code. Any tool that allow images to display in the terminal such as w3m or ueberzug may be possible.
